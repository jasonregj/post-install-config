<p>
Under the 'Admin Panel,' Go to Agents -> Roles -> Add New Role.

<br />

</p>
<p>
We are going to give this role Supreme Admin status. Under the Permissions tab, we're going to check all the boxes under Tickets, Tasks, and Knoweledge base and select 'Add Role' when complete. We've now just configured a new role.

</p>
<p>
We have not specifically configured some data such as 'manager' and 'SLA' yet so we will leave default settings for this example and select 'System Administrators' as the name of this department and select 'Create Department'
</p>
<br />

<p>
This team will be named Level I or II support. 
</p>
<br />

<p>

</p>
<p>
Again, we have not specifically configured individual members but so we will leave blank for now. When complete, select 'Create Team'. Repeat the same actions when you create the other Level Support Team and add its respective members.
</p>
<br />

</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
In the 'Access' Tab you can assign the Agent to a primary department depending on their skills/credentials with a role such as the 'Supreme Admin' role we created before. You can extend their access by assigning them to additional departments as well. 
</p>
<br />

<p>
Finally in the 'Permissions' Tab, this permits the Agent actions they may take to resolve tickets created by users. 
</p>
<br />

<p>

</p>
<p>
This SLA is named SEV-A for Level of Severity A (as being the top-most priority and requiring the most immediate resolution). For this example the Grace Period is 1 hour within a 24/7 Schedule. That means any day of the week/year, this ticket must be responded to within an hour. You can create additional SLA Plans (Levels of Severity) by following the same steps and adjusting the grace period and schedule. Then select 'Add Plan' to create the plan.

<p>
Admin Panel -> Manage -> Help Topics -> Add New Help Topic 
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/aqVUXgL.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
Give the Help Topic the name 'Business Critical Outage,' active status and type should be 'Public.' The Parent Topic is the level of criticality the topic belongs and should go to its respective level based on the organization and its needs. 
</p>
<br />

<p>
There is a way to configure emails to be sent to a specific address users can use with forms and the system will automatically generate a ticket for them. Many organizations do this for efficiency.
